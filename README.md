# AG Photography etc

## Description
This is my family photography website. It is made using bootstrap components. It is very similar to the one I made through Showit, but this one is made more by hand rather than drag and drop. 

## Future Road Map
Mostly just up keep and adding more images as they come. Hoping to add a blog type of thing for useful client info, and a am hoping to look into and implement lazy photo loading. Since this is a photography website, it does involve a lot of photos so it is a bit heavy. I had added images that are more website friendly, but it does involve many photos.
